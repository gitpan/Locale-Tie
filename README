NAME
    Locale::Tie - Get/set locale via (localizeable) variables

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Locale::Tie (from Perl
    distribution Locale-Tie), released on 2014-05-13.

SYNOPSIS
     use Locale::Tie qw($LANG);
     say "Current locale is ", $LANG; # -> en_US.UTF-8
     {
         local $LANG = 'id_ID';
         printf "%.2f\n", 12.34;  # -> 12,34
     }
     printf "%.2f\n", 12.34; # -> 12.34

DESCRIPTION
    This module is inspired by File::chdir, using a tied scalar variable to
    get/set stuffs. One benefit of this is being able to use Perl's "local"
    with it, effectively setting something locally.

EXPORTS
    They are not exported by default, but exportable.

  $LANG
TODO
    Support $LC_ALL, $LC_COLLATE, $LC_NUMERIC, etc.
